# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

Refactors code for accessibility including proper title, alt text for images, and replacing \<div\> with appropriate semantic tags. The stylesheet was also refactored to remove duplicate code and organized by area of page.

## Page Speed Results

Images were optimized for smaller file sizes. They were also shrunk to the sizes dictated by the stylesheet (original code remains as a fallback). A minified (index-min and style-min) version of the page has also been included.
